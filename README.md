# Augment-Linkage-Fentanyl-Networks--Public

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our **DAEN 690 Capstone Project**:  
**Augment Linkage: Evidence and Exploration**

This project investigates **fentanyl trafficking networks** by uncovering complex corporate linkages using interactive dashboards, graph databases, and curated data modeling.

## Project Overview

We explored hidden **communication** and **payment-based connections** among companies using:

- Shared identifiers (email, phone, chat)
- Normalized and curated datasets (not publicly shared)
- Multi-platform visualizations via **Tableau**, **Neo4j**, and **AWS Neptune**

## Visual Models (No Real Data Included)

### Tableau

- Tree-based visualization model using Tableau Extension Gallery
- Interactive filters and mock tooltips

### Neo4j Graph Schema

(BaseConsolidation)
‚îú‚îÄ[:HAS_METHOD]‚Üí (LinkageMethod)
‚îú‚îÄ[:HAS_LINKAGE]‚Üí (LinkageValue)
‚îî‚îÄ[:HAS_ASSOCIATED_COMPANY]‚Üí (AssociatedCompany)


Includes example Cypher queries for:
- Identifying top connected nodes
- Tracing indirect relationships

### AWS Neptune (Gremlin)

- Includes notebooks with:
  - Graph modeling patterns
  - Sample ingestion logic
  - Gremlin traversal patterns

## How to Use

| Platform | Instructions |
|----------|--------------|
| Tableau  | Load `.twbx`, enable Tree Extension (demo structure only) |
| Neo4j    | Launch local server, import schema and test queries        |
| Neptune  | Use Gremlin notebooks with placeholder data or local mocks |

## Dataset Notice

The following datasets were used **privately** during development:

- Curated Excel sheets with communication identifiers
- Normalized linkage files with corporate metadata
- Derived evidence scores and metadata

**These are not included** in this public repository.
